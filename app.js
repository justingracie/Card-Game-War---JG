//fill out their name and initiate gameplay.  after play two initiates cards will be dealt.


// dIVS for  player one and two will have image of cards, flipped cards will display in
//the battlezone.  will need to an array for deck of cards, then a loop to to iterate 
//through the array and randomly give every other card to player one and player two. 

//the cards will then be stored in the player constructor objects. 
//flip card button will drawer from player deck (living in constructor object), and
//display them in the battle zone. 

//battle zone DIV will need a function to determine highest card.  will need coniditionals
//that gives the player with the highest all the card within the battlezone, and add them 
//to their deck/object. 
//will also need a tie coniditional which requires players to flip again, drawing 3 facedown
// cards from their decks, and one faceupcard to determine winner of 'war'.  

//and another conditional which initiates another round of war upon a tie, and last conditional which 
// determines a winner if one players runs out of cards during 'war'.
