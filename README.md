GAME OF WAR

Project Description: 

This will be a browser based 2 player card game.  A full deck of cards gets split up between two players, for each round of play the players will flip a card from their respective decks.  The player with the highest card takes both cards and adds them to their deck (cards are scored on face value, Ace being highest, suits do not matter.)  If both players flip a card with the same face value this initiates a 'war'.  In this scenario players will place three cards face down and a fourth card face up, the higher of the face up card takes them all, if flipped cards are of the same face value again both players will place three more cards down and flip a fourth until a winner is reached.  If one play doesn't have enough cards to participate in a 'war' then they automatically lose the game.  Otherwise, the player who collects all of the cards in the deck wins the game.
