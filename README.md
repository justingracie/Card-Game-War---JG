# THE GAME OF WAR

The game of war is a two player browser based game card game.  This version of the game runs for 26 rounds or 'battles'.  During each battle a player flips a card from the top of their deck and the player with the highest scoring card wins the battle and adds both cards to their arsenal.  If players flip a card with the same score, neither player collects additional cards and the played cards move to the back of their decks.  The winner at the end of 26 battles is determined by who has the biggest arsenal at the end of those rounds. If the arsenals are the same size, there is a tie.
