        <div class="rules">
            <p>War is a 2 player card game with a simple objective, have the most cards at the end of 26 battles! A round begins with player 1 or player 2 flipping a card from their deck, the player with the higher card gets to take both cards and add it to their arsenal.  After you have completed 26 battles the player with the highest card count wins the game.  If you have the same number of cards after 26 rounds, the game is tied and you can choose to play again or leave it on the battle field. </p>
